    "'Actual use,' based on our August survey, reflects how their use has actually changed.",
    "Based on April and August 2020 surveys of residents of major cities in the US, Europe, and China; in each survey, n=approximately 5,000 respondents.",
    "Shared mobility includes taxi/ride hailing, pooled ride hailing, car sharing, bike sharing, and scooter sharing."
