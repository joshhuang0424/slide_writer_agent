    {
      "highlight": "",
      "text": "Over the last years the TMT sector in general and the telco and tech industry in particular have increased their sustainability ambitions: net zero targets have been pulled forward from often 2050 to even 2035"
    },
    {
      "highlight": "",
      "text": "The motivation for telco operators is clear: their carbon footprint has exceeded the footprint of the airline industry and will continue to grow with the increased data transportation in fixed and mobile networks if not managed proactively"
    },
    {
      "highlight": "",
      "text": "The historical focus of telco operators has been on scope 1 and scope 2 emissions - now scope 3 is very often focused (i.e. covering the entire supply chain) - two third of all emissions of a telco operator are typically scope 3 emissions"
    },
    {
      "highlight": "",
      "text": "In addition, “scope 4”, i.e. offering digital sustainability services which enable other industry sectors to become more sustainable, are becoming more important"
    },
    {
      "highlight": "",
      "text": "Hence, embracing sustainability is much more of an opportunity for telco operators than a burden - the business potential is enormous!"
    },
    {
      "highlight": "",
      "text": "Even some consumer segments show an increased interest to buy green telco services/products and even paying more for it!"
    },
    {
      "highlight": "",
      "text": "While the business opportunity is obvious, telco operators also need to watch out for liabilities in their balance sheets, i. e. (old) assets that consume a lot of energy - cost of capital will increase and share price will suffer if not managed proactively"
    },
    {
      "highlight": "",
      "text": "In 2020, performance of top scorer improved further, while bottom scorer had no overall improvement"
    },
    {
      "highlight": "",
      "text": "European telcos maintain sustainability index leadership"
    },
    {
      "highlight": "",
      "text": "However, significant improvements can be observed in Europe and in North American as well"
    },
    {
      "highlight": "",
      "text": "Main driver for 2020 sustainability improvement were the announcement of new targets - execution is still open"
    },
    {
      "highlight": "",
      "text": "While the best telco operator has reached two thirds of the best possible score, on average the telco industry has not even reached the 50% mark!"
    },
    {
      "highlight": "",
      "text": "Enabling other industries to become more sustainable is still the most neglected dimension"
